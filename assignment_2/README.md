# Linear Regression for GDP Prediction

This project uses Linear Regression to predict the GDP of different countries. Data was collected from https://data.worldbank.org/ and includes various economic indicators such as energy use, foreign direct investment, inflation, and labor force. Only data from 2000 and later was used to ensure accuracy. Real GDP was used as the dependent variable in the model. Check out the accompanying Jupyter notebook for more details!
