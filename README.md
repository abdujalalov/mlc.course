## Comparing Countries through Data Analysis
Welcome to my first EDA project! In this project, I have collected data from various sources about different countries and performed analysis on the data to discover interesting patterns and insights. The goal of the project was to explore the data and see what we could learn about different countries and how they compare. Through the process, I have used various data visualization techniques to help better understand the data and present the findings. I hope you enjoy exploring the project as much as I enjoyed working on it!
